# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Farming Biodiversity App is a responsive web application designed to help farmers increase biodiversity on their land through intelligent crop identification and companion planting recommendations. The application leverages Google's Gemini API for multimodal analysis of farm images and text descriptions, providing farmers with data-driven suggestions for compatible plants that can improve soil health, attract beneficial insects, and optimize crop yields through companion planting principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to upload images of my farmland or capture new photos using my device camera, so that I can get AI-powered identification of my existing crops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a farmer accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a prominent image upload section with mobile-first responsive design
2. WHEN a farmer clicks the upload button THEN the system SHALL accept JPEG and PNG image formats
3. WHEN a farmer uses a mobile device THEN the system SHALL provide camera integration using the web camera API for direct image capture
4. WHEN an image is selected or captured THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the image before submission
5. IF an unsupported file format is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prompt for a valid format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to add text descriptions of plants I've observed on my land, so that the AI can consider additional context beyond what's visible in the image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a farmer views the input form THEN the system SHALL provide a multi-line text area for plant descriptions
2. WHEN a farmer enters text descriptions THEN the system SHALL accept and store the text input alongside the image data
3. WHEN both image and text are provided THEN the system SHALL send both inputs to the Gemini API for comprehensive analysis
4. WHEN text input exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL provide character count feedback to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the AI to identify crops from my images and text descriptions, so that I can confirm what's currently growing on my land.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a farmer submits an image and optional text THEN the system SHALL send the data to the Gemini API for crop identification
2. WHEN the Gemini API processes the request THEN the system SHALL receive a structured list of identified crops
3. WHEN crop identification is complete THEN the system SHALL display the identified crops in a clear, readable format
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry
5. WHEN crops are identified THEN the system SHALL provide confidence indicators or allow manual verification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to manually correct or confirm AI-identified crops, so that I can ensure accurate data before receiving recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI crop identification results are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation options for each identified crop
2. WHEN a farmer disagrees with an identification THEN the system SHALL allow correction by selecting from a predefined crop list
3. WHEN a farmer needs to add a crop not in the predefined list THEN the system SHALL allow custom crop name entry
4. WHEN a farmer notices missing crops THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add additional crops to the list
5. WHEN all corrections are made THEN the system SHALL update the crop list and proceed with the confirmed data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the system to consider historical planting data for my area, so that recommendations account for seasonal patterns and previous crop rotations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes recommendations THEN it SHALL incorporate simulated historical planting data from a JSON structure
2. WHEN historical data is accessed THEN the system SHALL include information about plants grown in previous seasons
3. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL send historical context to the Gemini API alongside current crop data
4. IF historical data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL proceed with current crop data only and notify the user
5. WHEN historical data is used THEN the system SHALL indicate this context in the recommendation explanations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to receive AI-powered recommendations for companion plants, so that I can improve biodiversity and soil health on my farm.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN confirmed crop data is available THEN the system SHALL send crop list and historical data to Gemini API for recommendations
2. WHEN the Gemini API processes the recommendation request THEN it SHALL return compatible plants based on companion planting principles
3. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN each suggestion SHALL include the plant name and explanation of compatibility benefits
4. WHEN recommendations focus on polyculture THEN the system SHALL prioritize plants that improve soil health and attract beneficial insects
5. WHEN crop rotation principles apply THEN the recommendations SHALL consider seasonal timing and rotation benefits

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to view recommendation results in a clear, mobile-friendly format, so that I can easily understand and act on the suggestions while working in the field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommendations are ready THEN the system SHALL display results in a clean, easy-to-read format optimized for mobile devices
2. WHEN each recommendation is shown THEN the system SHALL include the plant name and detailed compatibility explanation
3. WHEN viewing results on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and usability across different screen sizes
4. WHEN recommendations are displayed THEN the system SHALL organize them by priority or compatibility strength
5. WHEN a farmer wants to save results THEN the system SHALL provide options to bookmark or export recommendations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the application to work reliably across different devices and network conditions, so that I can use it effectively in various farm environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL be responsive and functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN using Tailwind CSS THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, modern interface with consistent styling
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading indicators and error handling
4. WHEN API requests are processing THEN the system SHALL show clear progress feedback to the user
5. IF the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery options
